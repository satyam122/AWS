##EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or what we will call EC2 from here on out, is a compute service that allows you to provision virtual servers on demand. Each virtual server you provision is called an EC2 instance. Just about anything you can do with a server in a traditional sense, you can do with an EC2 instance. They would have to purchase those machines, wait for the delivery of those machines, install them, lay down the networking and storage systems for those servers, and then maintain that infrastructure to have any of their applications running. EC2 allows companies to provision servers on demand without acquiring massive capital to build out their compute infrastructure. In other words, if you need a server, you can just launch one, and it's available to you in minutes. EC2 instances are flexible, and you configure them to meet your needs. You can commission one or many instances easily, and at the end of the billing cycle, you only pay for what you use. When you no longer need an instance, terminate or stop that instance, and you will stop incurring charges. 

##ami


To select the operating system, you choose an Amazon Machine Image, or what we call an AMI. An AMI contains information about how you want your instance to be configured, including the operating system and possible applications to be installed on that instance. You can launch one or many instances from a single AMI, which would create multiple instances that all share the same configuration.

Roles are what allow one service in AWS to communicate with another service.
##tags
Tags are a feature that allow you to categorize your EC2 instances
